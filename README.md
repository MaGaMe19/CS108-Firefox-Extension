# CS-108 (EPFL) reformat Firefox extension

This firefox extension reformats all CS-108 pages (matching cs108.epfl.ch) to be more readable and somewhat nicer.

I'm working on getting it available officially, at the moment it can only be installed (temporarily) locally. See [this page](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/) for more information about that.
